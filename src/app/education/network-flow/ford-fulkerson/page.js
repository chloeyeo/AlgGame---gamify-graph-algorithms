    introduction: `The Ford-Fulkerson method is a fundamental algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem in a flow network. It works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths from source to sink through any available path-finding strategy. While the basic Ford-Fulkerson method allows for any path-finding approach, a notable improvement called the Edmonds-Karp algorithm specifically uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest augmenting paths.`,
    keyCharacteristics: [
      "Can use any strategy to find augmenting paths (DFS, random, etc.)",
      "Maintains both network and residual graphs",
      "Iteratively increases flow along found paths",
      "Terminates when no augmenting path exists",
      "Runtime varies based on path selection strategy",
      "Edmonds-Karp variation uses BFS for O(VEÂ²) complexity guarantee",
      "Flow Equilibrium: At each node (except source and sink), inflow equals outflow",
    ],
    applications: [
      "Network routing optimization",
